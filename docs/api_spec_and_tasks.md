## Required Python third-party packages:

```python
"""
google-cloud-bigquery
pyodbc
schedule
"""
```

## Required Other language third-party packages:

```python

No third-party packages required for other languages.

```

## Full API spec:

```python
"""
openapi: 3.0.0
...
description: A JSON object ...
"""
```

## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the program"),
    ("transfer_service.py", "Contains the TransferService class that handles data transfer"),
    ("config.py", "Contains the Config class for managing configuration settings"),
    ("logger.py", "Contains the Logger class for logging transfer status"),
    ("cli.py", "Contains the CLI class for running the command-line interface")
]
```

The dependencies between the files are as follows:
1. `main.py` depends on `transfer_service.py`, `config.py`, `logger.py`, and `cli.py`.
2. `transfer_service.py` depends on `config.py` and `logger.py`.
3. `cli.py` depends on `transfer_service.py`, `config.py`, and `logger.py`.

## Task list:

```python
[
    "config.py",
    "logger.py",
    "transfer_service.py",
    "cli.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

The tasks should be completed in the following order:
1. Implement `config.py`.
2. Implement `logger.py`.
3. Implement `transfer_service.py`.
4. Implement `cli.py`.
5. Implement `main.py`.
