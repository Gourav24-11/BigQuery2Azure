## Required Python third-party packages:

```python
"""
flask==1.1.2
bcrypt==3.2.0
"""
```

## Required Other language third-party packages:

```python
"""
No third-party ...
"""
```

## Full API spec:

```python
"""
openapi: 3.0.0
...
description: A JSON object ...
"""
```

## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the program"),
    ("config.py", "Contains configuration variables and functions"),
    ("bigquery.py", "Contains the BigQuery class for extracting data"),
    ("azure.py", "Contains the Azure class for loading data"),
    ("api.py", "Contains the API class for handling API requests"),
    ("scheduler.py", "Contains the Scheduler class for scheduling data transfers")
]
```

The dependencies between the files are as follows:
- main.py depends on config.py, bigquery.py, azure.py, api.py, and scheduler.py
- api.py depends on bigquery.py and azure.py
- scheduler.py depends on api.py

## Task list:

```python
[
    "config.py",
    "bigquery.py",
    "azure.py",
    "api.py",
    "scheduler.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge:

```python
"""
No shared knowledge ...
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR:

We need to clarify how the program should be started and ensure that all necessary third-party libraries are properly initialized.
