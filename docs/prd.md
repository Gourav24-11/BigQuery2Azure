## Original Requirements:

Create an API-based service that can transfer data from Google BigQuery to Azure database. The BigQuery data schema should be according to what it has stored from GA4, Google Search Console, and Google Ads data, and write scripts accordingly.

## Product Goals:
```python
[
    "Efficiently transfer data from Google BigQuery to Azure database",
    "Ensure the data schema is aligned with GA4, Google Search Console, and Google Ads data",
    "Provide a user-friendly API for easy data transfer"
]
```

## User Stories:
```python
[
    "As a data analyst, I want to easily transfer data from Google BigQuery to Azure database so that I can perform analysis on the data in Azure environment.",
    "As a developer, I want to have a standardized data schema for the transferred data so that I can easily integrate it into my applications.",
    "As a product manager, I want to have a user-friendly API for data transfer so that I can easily configure and monitor the data transfer process.",
    "As a business user, I want to have a reliable and efficient data transfer service so that I can make data-driven decisions based on the latest data in Azure database.",
    "As a data engineer, I want to have the ability to schedule and automate the data transfer process so that I can save time and effort."
]
```

## Competitive Analysis:
```python
[
    "Azure Data Factory: Provides data integration and transformation services, but may not have direct integration with Google BigQuery.",
    "Talend: Offers data integration and ETL solutions, but may require additional configuration for Google BigQuery to Azure database transfer.",
    "Stitch: Provides data pipeline services with support for Google BigQuery and Azure database, but may not have advanced data transformation capabilities.",
    "Matillion: Offers ETL solutions with support for Google BigQuery and Azure database, but may require coding for data transformation.",
    "Alooma: Provides data pipeline services with support for Google BigQuery and Azure database, but may have limitations on data volume and frequency.",
    "Fivetran: Offers data pipeline services with support for Google BigQuery and Azure database, but may require additional configuration for data transformation.",
    "Segment: Provides customer data platform with support for Google BigQuery and Azure database, but may not have advanced data transformation capabilities."

## Requirement Analysis:
The product should efficiently transfer data from Google BigQuery to Azure database while ensuring the data schema aligns with GA4, Google Search Console, and Google Ads data. It should provide a user-friendly API for easy configuration and monitoring of the data transfer process. The product should also support scheduling and automation of the data transfer process.

## Requirement Pool:
```python
[
    ("Support data transfer from Google BigQuery to Azure database", "P0"),
    ("Ensure data schema alignment with GA4, Google Search Console, and Google Ads data", "P0"),
    ("Provide a user-friendly API for easy configuration and monitoring", "P1"),
    ("Support scheduling and automation of the data transfer process", "P1")
]
```

## UI Design draft:
The UI design should include the following elements:
- Input fields for Google BigQuery and Azure database credentials
- Dropdown menus for selecting the tables and columns to transfer
- Checkbox options for enabling data transformation and scheduling
- Progress bar for monitoring the data transfer process
- Log display for viewing transfer logs
- Save and execute buttons for configuring and initiating the data transfer

The UI should have a clean and modern style with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Anything UNCLEAR:
There are no unclear points.
