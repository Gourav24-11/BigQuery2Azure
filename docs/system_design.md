## Implementation approach:
To implement the tool that integrates with Google BigQuery APIs and transfers data to an Azure database, we will use the following approach:

1. Use the `google-cloud-bigquery` library to connect to Google BigQuery and retrieve data.
2. Use the `pyodbc` library to connect to the Azure database and insert data.
3. Implement a data transfer service that fetches data from Google BigQuery in chunks, transforms it if required, and inserts it into the Azure database.
4. Use the `schedule` library to schedule regular data transfers at specific intervals.
5. Implement error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure data integrity and provide troubleshooting information.
6. Design a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the tool and configure transfer settings.

## Python package name:
```python
"bigquery_to_azure"
```

## File list:
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "transfer_service.py",
    "config.py",
    "logger.py",
    "cli.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions:
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class TransferService{
        +__init__(source_project_id: str, source_dataset_id: str, destination_connection_string: str)
        +transfer_data(chunk_size: int, transform_func: Optional[Callable] = None) -> None
    }
    class Config{
        +__init__(config_file: str)
        +get(key: str) -> Any
        +set(key: str, value: Any) -> None
    }
    class Logger{
        +__init__(log_file: str)
        +log(message: str) -> None
    }
    class CLI{
        +__init__(transfer_service: TransferService, config: Config, logger: Logger)
        +run() -> None
    }
    TransferService "1" -- "1" Config: has
    TransferService "1" -- "1" Logger: has
    CLI "1" -- "1" TransferService: uses
    CLI "1" -- "1" Config: uses
    CLI "1" -- "1" Logger: uses
```

## Program call flow:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant TS as TransferService
    participant C as Config
    participant L as Logger
    participant CL as CLI

    M->>C: Initialize Config
    M->>L: Initialize Logger
    M->>TS: Initialize TransferService
    M->>CL: Initialize CLI with TransferService, Config, and Logger
    CL->>CL: Run CLI
    CL->>TS: Transfer data
    TS->>TS: Fetch data from Google BigQuery
    TS->>TS: Transform data (if required)
    TS->>TS: Insert data into Azure database
    TS->>TS: Repeat until all data is transferred
    TS->>L: Log transfer status
    TS->>TS: Return
    CL->>CL: Exit CLI
    M->>L: Exit Logger
```

## Anything UNCLEAR:
The requirements are clear to me.
